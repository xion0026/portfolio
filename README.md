## My Prototype
My original prototype is a makeup website but I want to create my own portfolio so I modified some layout and mock up, and I created paper prototype for this project. But the visual style is match with orignial.  

## Build Web
I Have laid out the entire website before I start to build the website, but bugs often appear during my operation. I checked the learning materials and video sometimes. I think google search also is an efficient way to help me solve the bug.  
Compared with the previous website, I pay more attention to the visual and beauty of this website to highlight a designer, but I donâ€™t seem to be doing well enough.
On the portfolio page, I add some links with **Adobe XD High-Fidelity Prototype - digital prototype** and own **CMS website**.
